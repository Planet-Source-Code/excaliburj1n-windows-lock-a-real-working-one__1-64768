### Description

Ok hopefully this works this time if it doesnt get deleted , it's a real working lock down with a nice Interface i made :),Disables Alt+Tab *WORKS*,and does a bunch more than that i wrote everything except the modules if you use them to please leave the respected authors name in it, also i tested it on Win XP Home/Pro both sp1/sp2 so you should have no problems, just remember to spot the password in the code before running it else restart your computer
